Dosboxloader from within a conf file saved as a cmd file.
It let you put a dosbox conf inside a cmd file.

copy dbldr.exe to x:\os2\apps (or whatever directory in your path environment.

Edit the example.cmd file, at least the autoexec part to start you game (or whatever program).
Then save this file as game.cmd (or whatever name) in your game dir (or whatever dir).
Optional create or find an icon and save this icon as the same name (game.ico) in the same dir.
Create a desktop object and set it to start minimized.
You do need a TEMP or TMP evironment variable in config.sys!
